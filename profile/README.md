## Drupal 6 LTS Fork and Additonal Contrib modules with ðŸ§™PHP8 Support

### Current available project list:

* Drupal 6 core
* DBTNG - backport/early version of Drupal 7 database API

### Possible releases:

These are the contrib modules I have running personally on both PHP 7.4 and 8.1/8.2 that are pretty much all working on PHP8 (aside from HybridAuth which has some library compatilbity issues that I need to resolve). Basically if you find something not working in PHP8 from the below list I should be able to push up a working version.
